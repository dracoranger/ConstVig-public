#premade sql queries are as follows
searchsqlflowsportin('port as string',getcur()) - shows flows matching port in
searchsqlflowsportout('port as string',getcur()) - shows flows matching port out
searchsqlflowsflags('minimun number of flags as string',getcur()) - finds flows that have a minimum number of flags
searchsqlportinwithflags('port as string',getcur()) - shows flows that have flags present given the port in 
searchsqlportoutwithflags('port as string',getcur()) - shows flows that have flags present given the port out 
searchsql(inp,cur) - generalized search function on sql.  feeds query directly to database, so needs to be a valid sql query =
